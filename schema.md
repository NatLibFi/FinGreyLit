# Metadata Schema

These fields are used in the metadata records. Most fields are adapted from Dublin Core, but some are custom adaptations or ad-hoc extensions.
The type column indicates whether the field is allowed to have only a single value or multiple values, or whether it's a sub-object:

- S: single-value
- M: multi-value 
- O: object

For some statistics on actual usage of these metadata fields in different types of document, see the [statistics report](statistics.md).

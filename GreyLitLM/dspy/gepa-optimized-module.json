Each page object contains `page` (the page number) and `text` (the OCR‑extracted plain‑text of that page). |\n\nYour job is to produce **one JSON object** that follows the schema below.  \nIf a field cannot be determined, use the exact empty value indicated (`null` for scalars, `[]` for lists).  \nAll string values must be plain ASCII – normalise quotes to `\"` (or the apostrophe `’`), collapse multiple spaces to a single space, and trim leading/trailing whitespace.\n\n---\n\n## Output JSON Schema\n\n| Field | Type | Required format / rules |\n|-------|------|--------------------------|\n| `language` | string | ISO‑639‑1 code. Scan **the first 200 characters of the *concatenated* text of the whole document** (i.e. `pages[0].text + pages[1].text + …`). If any of the characters **ä ö Ä Ö å Å** appear, set to `\"fi\"`; otherwise `\"en\"`. |\n| `title` | string | Main title of the work. <br>1. If `pdfinfo.title` exists → clean it and use it. <br>2. Otherwise, read the text of page 1 (`pages[0].text`). Split it into lines (preserve order). <br>   * Skip empty lines. <br>   * Skip lines that start with a markdown heading marker (`#`, `##`, `###`, …). <br>   * Skip lines that look like an author line (see *Creator extraction*). <br>   * The **first** remaining line that is ≥ 6 characters becomes the *candidate* title. <br>3. **Title‑line extensions** – if the candidate line ends with a colon **or** the next line is non‑empty, starts with a capital letter and is not an author line, concatenate it (single space). Repeat while the same condition holds. <br>4. If a line contains one of the explicit title markers `Title:`, `Thesis:`, `Master’s Thesis:`, `Doctoral Thesis:` (case‑insensitive), take the text **after the colon** (trimmed) as the title (overriding step 2). <br>5. Keep any subtitle as part of the title (do **not** split on the colon). <br>6. Clean the final string (collapse spaces, normalise quotes). |\n| `alt_title` | list of strings | Any **alternative** titles, e.g. a translation, a subtitle given in another language, or a title that appears inside quotation marks (`“ ”`, `\" \"`). Return each cleaned title as a separate element. Do **not** duplicate the main title. |\n| `creator` | list of strings | Authors in **“Surname, Given‑Name”** order. <br>1. If `pdfinfo.author` exists → split on commas, semicolons, the word “and”, or line‑breaks. <br>2. Clean each fragment (trim, collapse spaces). <br>3. For each name: <br>   * If it matches the pattern `First Last` (two words, each starting with a capital letter) → reorder to `Last, First`. <br>   * If it already matches `Last, First` keep as‑is. <br>4. If `pdfinfo.author` is missing, scan the **first five non‑empty lines of page 1** for personal‑name patterns (`First Last`, `Last, First`, or a line that starts with a capitalised list of names). Collect **all** matches. <br>5. Remove duplicates, keep order of appearance. |\n| `year` | integer or null | Publication year. <br>1. If `pdfinfo.creationDate` or `pdfinfo.modDate` exists, extract the **first four digits** (they are always a year) and use that. <br>2. If both are missing, search the whole document for the **first** four‑digit number between 1900‑2099 that appears in a publication‑information context (e.g. after “Year:”, “©”, “© 2021”, “2021.”). If none, return `null`. |\n| `publisher` | list of strings | Institution responsible for the work. <br>• **Theses / dissertations** → the awarding university or faculty (e.g. “University of Vaasa”). Detect by looking for keywords: “University”, “Yliopisto”, “Universität”, “Akademi”, “Institute”, “College”, “School”, “Faculty”. Return each distinct institution once, preserving order of first appearance. <br>• **Research reports** → the organisation that produced the report (same keyword list). <br>• **Journal articles** → `[]`. |\n| `doi` | string or null | DOI if present. Detect case‑insensitive pattern `10\\.\\d{4,9}/\\S+`. If the match is preceded by a URL (`http://`, `https://`, `doi.org/`), strip that part. Remove trailing punctuation characters `.,;:`. Return the bare DOI (e.g. `10.1000/xyz123`). |\n| `e_isbn` | list of strings | **Electronic** ISBN‑13 numbers. Detect ISBN‑13 (13 digits, hyphens optional) with the regex `\\b(?:97[89][-\\s]?)?\\d{1,5}[-\\s]?\\d{1,7}[-\\s]?\\d{1,7}[-\\s]?\\d\\b`. For each match, look at up to **30 characters before and after** the match. If any of the **electronic cues** appear, add the ISBN (with **all hyphens and spaces removed**) to `e_isbn`. Electronic cues (case‑insensitive): `digital`, `electronic`, `e‑ISBN`, `(digital)`, `pdf`, `PDF`, `sid.` (when used for electronic), `online`. |\n| `p_isbn` | list of strings | **Print** ISBN‑13 numbers. Same detection as `e_isbn` but require at least one **print cue** in the ±30‑character window. Print cues (case‑insensitive): `print`, `paper`, `hardcover`, `(print)`, `Painettu`, `Print`. If both electronic and print cues are present, **electronic wins** (the ISBN goes only to `e_isbn`). Store the ISBN without hyphens/spaces. |\n| `e_issn` | string or null | Electronic ISSN (8 digits, optional hyphen). Detect with `\\b\\d{4}[-\\s]?\\d{3}[\\dX]\\b`. Apply the same cue logic as for ISBN. Return the ISSN **exactly as it appears** (keep the hyphen if present). |\n| `p_issn` | string or null | Print ISSN (same detection, print‑cue logic). Return the ISSN exactly as it appears (keep hyphen). |\n| `type_coar` | string | COAR‑compatible resource type. Scan the **entire document** (case‑insensitive) and apply the **first** matching rule in this order: <br>1. **doctoral thesis** – contains any of: “doctoral thesis”, “dissertation”, “PhD”, “doctoral”, “väitöskirja”, “väitöskirjan”. <br>2. **master thesis** – contains any of: “master’s thesis”, “master thesis”, “maisteri”, “maisterintutkielma”. <br>3. **journal article** – contains typical journal citation elements (journal name, volume, issue, pages) **or** the word “article” together with a DOI or ISSN, **or** a pattern like “Vol. X, No. Y, pp. Z‑W”. <br>4. **conference proceeding** – contains “conference”, “proceedings”, “paper presented at”. <br>5. **research report** – contains “report”, “raportti”, “tutkimusraportti”, “research report”. <br>6. **research** – fallback for any other research‑type document. <br>Return the exact lower‑case string (e.g. `doctoral thesis`). |\n\n---\n\n## Extraction Procedure (Step‑by‑Step)\n\n1. **Parse the input JSON** safely. Ignore any keys that are not listed above.  \n2. **Normalise dates**: `creationDate` / `modDate` are strings like `D:20201216144002+02'00'`. Extract the first four digits as the year (they are always at the start of the string).  \n3. **Detect language** using the rule in the schema (first 200 characters of concatenated text).  \n4. **Title extraction** (see detailed rules under the `title` field). Pay special attention to explicit markers (`Title:`, `Thesis:` etc.).  \n5. **Alternative titles** – look for quoted strings (`“…”`, `\"...\"`) anywhere in the document, and for subtitles that appear on a separate line after a colon. Do not duplicate the main title.  \n6. **Creator extraction** – follow the rules under `creator`. When scanning for names on page 1, use the following regular expressions (case‑sensitive): <br>`\\b[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b` (First Last) <br>`\\b[A-Z][a-z]+, *[A-Z][a-z]+(?: [A-Z][a-z]+)*\\b` (Last, First). Collect all matches, then apply the ordering rule.  \n7. **Year** – apply the rule in the schema. If you have to fall back to searching the text, ignore years that appear inside parentheses of a citation (e.g. “(2020)” after a reference). Prefer the first plausible year after the title block.  \n8. **Publisher detection** – first determine `type_coar`. If the document is a thesis, search the whole text for the first occurrence of a university/faculty keyword list and capture the whole phrase (e.g. “University of Vaasa”, “Åbo Akademi University”). Return it as a single‑element list. For research reports, look for the organisation name that appears near the title or in a header/footer. For journal articles, return an empty list.  \n9. **ISBN / ISSN extraction** – use the regexes supplied. For each match, extract the surrounding 30‑character context and decide electronic vs print using the cue lists. Remove hyphens/spaces from ISBNs before storing; keep ISSNs exactly as found (including hyphen). Ensure each identifier appears only once in the appropriate list.  \n10. **DOI extraction** – apply the DOI regex, strip leading URL parts, and trailing punctuation. Return the bare DOI in lower‑case. If none, set to `null`.  \n11. **Resource type (`type_coar`)** – apply the ordered rule list exactly as described. The first category that matches determines the value.  \n12. **Assemble the output** JSON. Preserve the key order shown in the schema for readability (order is not technically required, but it helps testing). Use `null` for missing scalar values and `[]` for missing list values.\n\n---\n\n## Cleaning & Normalisation Details\n\n* **Whitespace** – collapse any sequence of whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) to a single space. Trim leading/trailing spaces.  \n* **Quotes** – replace any fancy quotation marks (`“ ” ‘ ’ „ “ …`) with plain ASCII `\"` (or the apostrophe `’`).  \n* **Hyphens in identifiers** – remove all hyphens (`-`) and spaces from ISBNs before storing. **Do not** remove hyphens from ISSNs; keep them exactly as they appear.  \n* **Case** – identifiers (DOI) are stored in lower‑case; ISBN/ISSN are numeric/alphabetic only, so case does not matter.  \n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls (What Previously Went Wrong)\n\n| Issue | What caused it | Correct handling |\n|-------|----------------|-----------------|\n| **Wrong language** | Scanned only the first page instead of the first 200 characters of the whole document. | Concatenate all page texts, take the first 200 characters, then apply the Finnish‑character rule. |\n| **Title wrong** | Ignored explicit title markers (`Thesis:`) and concatenated the whole heading line. | If a line contains `Title:`, `Thesis:`, `Master’s Thesis:`, `Doctoral Thesis:` (case‑insensitive), use the text after the colon as the title. Otherwise follow the candidate‑line logic. |\n| **Alt‑titles missing** | Did not look for quoted strings or subtitle lines. | Search the whole document for text inside `“ ”` or `\" \"` and for subtitle lines that appear after a colon on a separate line. |\n| **Creator over‑inclusion** | Added non‑author names (e.g., supervisors) or failed to reorder names. | Only use `pdfinfo.author` or name patterns on page 1. Do **not** include lines that contain words like “Supervisor”, “Advisor”, “Editor”. Reorder `First Last` → `Last, First`. |\n| **Publisher wrong** | Took the first institution mentioned anywhere, even if it was a journal publisher. | First determine `type_coar`. If it is a thesis, look for the awarding university/faculty; for reports, look for the producing organisation; for journal articles return `[]`. |\n| **ISBN/ISSN classification** | Assigned identifiers to the wrong list because cues were not checked, or removed hyphens from ISSNs. | Examine the ±30‑character window for electronic or print cues. If both appear, assign to `e_isbn` (electronic wins). Keep ISSNs exactly as they appear (including hyphen). |\n| **DOI extraction** | Kept surrounding punctuation or URL parts. | Strip any leading `http://`, `https://`, `doi.org/` and trailing punctuation `.,;:`. Return the bare DOI in lower‑case. |\n| **type_coar mis‑classification** | Applied “article” rule too early, causing theses to be labelled as `doctoral thesis`. | Follow the ordered list strictly: **doctoral thesis** → **master thesis** → **journal article** → **conference proceeding** → **research report** → **research**. The first matching rule wins. |\n\n---\n\n**Remember:**  \n- Follow the **order of precedence** for each field exactly as described.  \n- Use the cue‑based approach for ISBN/ISSN to decide electronic vs print.  \n- Detect the resource type in the exact order listed; the first match determines `type_coar`.  \n- Return `null` for missing scalar values and `[]` for missing list values.  \n\nGood luck! 🎯",
